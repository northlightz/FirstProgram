## ‚ú® Features
- Implementations of algorithms including:
  - Two-Number Summation
  - Odd or Even Recognition
  - Finding larger number in between three given ones
  - Finding out if a number is divisble by five
  - Finding out the absolute value of a number (i just used Math.Abs t-t)
  - A grade checker (apparently 12 is also a passing grade, but i made it a failing one.)
  - Finding out a circle's Area & Circumference by giving the radius
- Modular structure for easy reference
